Every week I participated in training sessions there, gaining hands-on knowledge about entrepreneurship, fundraising, and product development, all while collaborating closely with five other teammates.","My role focused on the technical backbone of the product. I designed and implemented a Qt-based graphical user interface, integrated it with an embedded processor, and carried out system loop testing to ensure real-time performance, stability, and reliability under operational load. These efforts were critical in taking our very first prototype and transforming it into a production-ready second-generation machine within just six months. This new generation product featured an interactive touchscreen, a rich set of recipes, and AI-assisted meal recommendations: a leap that turned our vision into something tangible and exciting.","One of the proudest moments of this journey was representing VersaWare at CES 2023. There, I showcased our product to investors, journalists, and potential partners, sharing not only the technical innovations but also the energy and passion of building something groundbreaking from the ground up."],images:["/images/versaboard.jpg","/images/versabowl.jpg","/images/versame.jpg"],imageMaxH:"max-h-[300px]",link:{label:"CES 2023 News Article",href:"https://us.aving.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=50125"}},{role:"\xc6r Metrica Air Sensor",org:"Product Innovation Institute",time:"2023",detail:["CLEAN AIR, CLEAR MIND","Know how much pollution is around you","Breathe better cabin air with automation","Build the world's most detailed air quality map","Our product can evaluate the air quality inside and outside of a vehicle.
