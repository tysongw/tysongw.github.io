Every week I participated in training sessions there, gaining hands-on knowledge about entrepreneurship, fundraising, and product development, all while collaborating closely with five other teammates.","My role focused on the technical backbone of the product. I designed and implemented a Qt-based graphical user interface, integrated it with an embedded processor, and carried out system loop testing to ensure real-time performance, stability, and reliability under operational load. These efforts were critical in taking our very first prototype and transforming it into a production-ready second-generation machine within just six months. This new generation product featured an interactive touchscreen, a rich set of recipes, and AI-assisted meal recommendations: a leap that turned our vision into something tangible and exciting.","One of the proudest moments of this journey was representing VersaWare at CES 2023.
